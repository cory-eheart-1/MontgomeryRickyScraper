# MontgomeryRickyScraper

I wrote this python script to check if the album Montgomery Ricky by Ricky Montgomery was in stock on vinyl. I scraped the website and used a couple of python statements to determine if the site said it was in stock or out of stock. I used the winToast library to display the update as a Windows notification. The script also runs on a cycle, so every so much time the script would check on the stock and update me.
